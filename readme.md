# Object in Java Script

>  In JavaScript, an `object` is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics. Everything is an object in JavaScript.
